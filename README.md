## Jamie O'Roke — Portfolio

Personal portfolio and project showcase built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Firebase Hosting**.  
This site highlights my work in web, mobile, and Python automation — all hosted on GitHub Pages.  
It is also a legitimate, registered, and insured company that I founded, mainly to see how plausible it would be.
Turns out, it's not too hard to start a company; however, keeping the company running and expanding is the real challenge.
